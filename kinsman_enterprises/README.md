I had a pretty difficult time with this dev.
I am close to EOD so I figured I would spend the remaining of the time clarifying the steps I took.

The first step I took was going through the work flow and finding where the consumer wants the price and add to cart hidden. Initially I started with simply adding a boolean field to the res.config.settings for the system parameters

I managed to do this (granted the xpath was very poorly implemented which is something I need to work on) I dumped a fair amount of time trying to make it look pretty but eventually realized it was a poor use of my time.

I discussed with my mentor Martin and he advised to not spend too much time since I did manage to get the settings to save albeit being a dead button

Next step is to inherit the qweb template?
I think the best use of my remaining time is reviewing the qweb documents before spewing out illogical code
